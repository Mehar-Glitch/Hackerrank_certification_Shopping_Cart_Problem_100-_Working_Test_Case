# Hackerrank_certification_Shopping_Cart_Problem_100-_Working_Test_Case

 The code starts by importing the necessary libraries.
 
 Python has a built-in function len that returns the length of a list, and total that calculates the sum of all values in a list.
 
 The ShoppingCart class is created, and its three methods are defined: add , total , and len .
 
 The add method takes an item as input and stores it in the cart_names list, along with its price .
 
 The total method calculates the sum of all prices in the cart_prices list, and len prints out the number of items in the cart_names list.
 
 Next, n variables are set up to hold integer values.
 
 These will be used later to control how many items are displayed onscreen at any given time.
 
 A for loop is then started, which iterates over each value in n .
 
 Each time through the loop, input() is called to get user input for name and price .
 
 These values are then split into two pieces using a comma ( , ) delimiter, and stored in variables name and price .
 
 Finally, an Item object is created based on these inputs.
 
 This object has two fields: name , which holds the user's chosen item name; and price , which holds the user's chosen price.

 The code creates a ShoppingCart class and an Item class.
 
 The ShoppingCart class has two methods: add and total.
 
 The add method takes an item as input and adds it to the ShoppingCart's list of items.
 
 The total method calculates the sum of all the items in the ShoppingCart's list.
 
 Finally, the code prints out the contents of the ShoppingCart's list using different commands.
 
 If you run this code on your computer, you'll see that adding an item to a shopping cart costs 0 units of currency.
